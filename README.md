# Simple Java lotto number generation app

A basic Java application that emulates a lottery slikpik ticket

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Windows / macOS / Linux

## How to Run

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the files were cloned
Compile the Java file into bytecode using javac:
bash

javac Main.java

If compilation is successful, a new file named Main.class will be created in the same directory. If there are errors in your code, the command prompt will display them.
Run the compiled Java class using the java command, specifying the class name without the .class extension:
bash

java Main

The program will then execute, and any output (like "Hello World!") will appear in your terminal. 

  
  Alternatively, open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio and press **F5**.
